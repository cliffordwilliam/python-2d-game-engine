# Project Name

This is my python 2D game engine project. I will work on it while making a game along side of it as a proof of concept. It comes with json editor, level editor and the game engine itself. There is no GUI but there are helpful classes out of the box you can use for common things like animation, saving, key binding, collision, camera and so much more.

## Motivation

This project is the only thing right now that motivates me to keep going in life, my long term goal is to make a series out of this game. I will share more as I am also working on a blog to showcase my development, devlog.

## Python Version

This project is developed and tested with Python 3.12.3.
